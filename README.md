# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline for Python Project

This repository contains a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Python project, following the DevSecOps model. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions.

## Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the build, testing, security scanning, and deployment processes for the Python project. The pipeline includes the following stages:

1. **Build:**
   - Checks out the code.
   - Sets up the Python environment.
   - Installs project dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Security Scan:**
   - Uses `bandit` to perform a security scan on the codebase.

3. **Test:** // This will add shortly
   - Runs tests using `pytest` to ensure code quality.

4. **Deploy:**
   - Deploys the application to the production environment (placeholder script, customize as needed).

5. **Complete Pipeline:**
   - Represents the completion of the entire CI/CD pipeline, depending on all previous stages.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository.
- Python project with necessary files, including `requirements.txt` and test cases.
- Adjust the provided `requirements.txt` with your project's dependencies.
- Replace the deployment placeholder in the workflow script with your actual deployment script or command.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
